## Battleship
A 2D "battleship" (viewing from "up") and some barriers in a small world
  - University of Limerick, Computer Graphics II, Assignment 3
  - Very messy code, but it was a pain to write it due to lack of instructions, time and documentation
  - OpenSceneGraph for drawing things
  - C++ to handle logic
  - Call to a Lua file which parses a file holding data about barriers and calls a C++ function
  - Worked on the university's linux servers, could not make OpenSceneGraph work on my Windows laptop
